# The Anatomy of Web Apps Demo: A Message Board Application

Demo repository for CS SAIL @ Illinois 2022.

## Getting Started

To run this web application, open a new terminal and run the `start` script like so:

```shell
$ chmod +x ./start.sh && ./start.sh
```

(For subsequent runs of the web server, you just need to use `./start.sh`).
